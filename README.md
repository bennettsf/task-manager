## Assignment: TaskManager with React State using React Expo 

I ran into a few challenges with this one. Mapping elements in React Native is a bit different without list elements in traditional html. 
Other than that everything was pretty straight forward. I used spread syntax for adding tasks and toggling the completed boolean property. 
I also decided to make a simple clearTasks method but if I were to go deeper into this assignment, I would add a deleteTask button for each task.
